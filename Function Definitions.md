# Function Definitions

A function allows you to segment code and apply it wherever necessary without the redundancy of rewriting it.

```python

def function_name(attribute):
	
	# Function code

```

The function above is called `function_name` and it has 1 attribute called `attribute` attached to it. To run this function I need to call `function_name(attribute)` and replace `attribute` with a variable I want to use within the function (functions can be defined without ant attributes).

### Function Return

```python

def function_name(attribute):
	
	# Function code
	
	return value

```

A function `return` is used to return a value from a function. This can be used as a way of performing an operation on a variable defore feeding it back to the overall sequence.

```python

value = function_name(some_attribute)

```
