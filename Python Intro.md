# Python Cheat Sheet

### [[ Variable Assignment ]]

Assign variables with the '=' sign and a vaiable name.

```python

string_variable = "variable contents"

intVariable = 123

floatvariable = 1.23

bool_variable_ = True

```

Variables in python can take a multitide of data types including the simple datatypes above (string, integer, float, boolean). Find more information at [[ Variable Assignment ]].


### [[ Select Statements ]]

Select statements are used to make a diverting choice in your code, chosing to run or not run a particular section.

```python

if (condition):
	
	# Run this code
	
else:

	# Run this other code

```

An `if` statement will run the code in the first section if the `condition` is `True`, if the condition returns `False` the code in the `else` section will run.


### [[ Iteration Statements ]]

Iteration lets you repeat code multiple times depending on a condition. The most common type of iteration is a `for` loop.

```python

for i in range(10):
	
	# Repeat this code 10 times

```

This will iterate over the code once for each value in the `range`, in this case 10 times, and will store the current value of `range` in `i`. The value for `i` can then be used for operations in the code, though only inside the `for` loop.


### [[ Function Definitions ]]

A function allows you to segment code and apply it wherever necessary without the redundancy of rewriting it.

```python

def 

```
